Art3misRAT

Art3misRAT is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) designed for Windows environments and written in Rust.

Features:

PowerShell Execution: Executes PowerShell commands with the ability to return the output to the server.

Persistence Mechanism: Ensures the RAT starts with Windows by adding a registry key.

AES-256 Encryption: Encrypts all communications between the RAT and the command-and-control (C2) server using AES-256 encryption.

Environment Awareness: Detects if running in a virtualized environment and exits if so, to prevent analysis.

Design

Art3misRAT consists of two main components:


Art3misRAT (Client)

The malware that runs on the infected machine.
Establishes a connection to the C2 server.
Sets up persistence by adding a registry key.
Listens for incoming commands, decrypts them, and executes them.
Returns the output of the commands to the C2 server.

Art3misServer (Server)

Listens on a specified port for incoming connections.
Sends encrypted commands to the connected clients.
Receives and decrypts the responses from the clients.
    
Commands

!!kill: Terminates the RAT process.

Example:

    !!kill
    
!!powershell or !!ps: Executes a PowerShell command.

Example: 

    !!powershell Get-Process

    !!ps Get-Process
